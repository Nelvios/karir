It\u2019s exciting because in the blink of an eye Google will remove almost all barriers to entry in gaming and allow anyone to play any game on any device. That\u2019s huge. But it\u2019s a looming crisis because this is Google. And Google runs YouTube. It\u2019s an almighty\u00a0<a class=\"bb-a\" href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Crisitunity\">crisitunity</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"bb-p\">Right now,\u00a0<a class=\"bb-a\" href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/google-stadia-games-console-service-gdc-keynote\">Google Stadia</a>\u00a0isn\u2019t really anything other than a bold, technically impressive demo. And boy is it impressive. But caveats abound. In the stop-start history of games streaming \u2013 and let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s mostly been stop \u2013 we\u2019ve been here before. But Stadia is tantalisingly different: it\u2019s an ambitious bid to create a single platform for gaming and fundamentally change the entire industry. And Google definitely has the skills to pull it off.</p>\n<p class=\"bb-p\">But here\u2019s the conundrum for the games industry \u2013 and gamers. Will Stadia do to games what YouTube has done to video? A frantic, algorithmically-powered race for attention that\u2019s great for Google\u2019s profits but, at times, bad for creatives. For a sneak preview, look at the free-to-play mobile gaming industry. Here, games that rely on how long people are willing to play \u2013 and thus how many adverts they see or in-game items they buy \u2013 are markedly different from console games. That\u2019s not a specific issue with Google, but one the games industry as a whole (Nintendo aside, perhaps) will have to tackle as it moves from pay-per-game to games streaming.</p>\n<p class=\"bb-p\">That issue of changing the financial incentive for publishers is right at the core of what Google is proposing. Just like YouTube wasn\u2019t about putting the TV on the internet, Stadia isn\u2019t about shoehorning home console games onto a cloud streaming service. It\u2019s about making gaming ubiquitous, never more than a click away from almost every corner of the internet. Which raises another question: who is Stadia for?</p>", "title": "If Google Stadia is the future, the games industry should be worried", "tag": "event,news", "id": 7, "thumbImage": "/assets/content/articles/article-image/7/thumbnail-image.jpg"}}
