{"article":{"id":2,"article":"<p>In the past, BCA and their partners used to visit various campuses to give presentations. I was captivated by their presentation and gladly took the tests to join BCA. After taking the evaluation and personality test, I had to attend training for 4 months. Finally, I passed the interview and became a part of BCA.</p>\n<p>I believe that BCA has a clear vision of what they want to do in the future. I began my career as a programmer. At first, we worked with vendors but soon enough, we no longer needed to and I was promoted to my current position. As part of the IT department, I am involved in many projects that ensures an outstanding back office. At BCA, I was given the freedom to express myself both inside and outside of work. Each and every person is valued and although we have to work hard,\u00a0 we still have time for the things we like outside of work. We have a community which allows individuals with the same interests to do activities that they enjoy together.</p>","title":"Samuel Martin Lenakoly","tag":"news,article","date":"2019-08-16","thumbImage":"/assets/content/articles/article-image/2/thumbnail-image.jpg"}}
