{"data": {"date": "2019-03-19", "title": "PlayStation Vue now lets you watch four channels at once on Apple TV", "article": "<p id=\"Kaw9O2\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; text-decoration-line: inherit; vertical-align: inherit; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 1.2rem; padding: 0px; color: #424242;\">Sony is bringing PlayStation Vue&rsquo;s multi-view feature, which lets users view several channels at once, to the Apple TV today. Until now, multi-view has only worked on the company&rsquo;s own PlayStation 4 console, so it&rsquo;s nice to see other devices getting one of Vue&rsquo;s unique perks. The PS4 can stream three channels simultaneously, but the Apple TV app will now be able to display four live channels at the same time. Sony&rsquo;s internet TV service starts at $44.99 per month and goes up to $79.99 for the top-tier channel package.</p>\n<p id=\"f7M2jP\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; text-decoration-line: inherit; vertical-align: inherit; font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: inherit; margin: 0px 0px 1.2rem; padding: 0px; color: #424242;\">Sony believes this functionality is most beneficial to sports fans, as they can keep an eye on multiple games without having to flip back and forth between them. So it&rsquo;s probably no coincidence that multi-view is debuting on Apple TV in time for the 2019 March Madness college basketball tournament. Aside from sports, I&rsquo;ve found the feature to be handy for comparing coverage of breaking news events across different networks.</p>", "id": 3}}
