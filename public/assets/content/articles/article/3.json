I previously worked as an IT Support in another company for 2 years before applying to BCA\u2019s Development Program (BDP). I guess it was my destiny to work in IT because at the end I work as an IT staff in BCA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At first, I was a part of the IT Business Solution team in BCA which supports developers with Functional Specification Design (FSD) or simply the technical documentation. Then, I joined the Scrum team as a Scrum Master who is in charge of guiding and facilitating the Scrum team ensuring that everything is running properly. Luckily, I was given the opportunity to take the Scrum certification that was sponsored\u00a0 by BCA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, I am a part of the IT Branding team who is in charge of both external and internal branding at BCA.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being in different teams with different job descriptions, I was given the chance to learn and improve upon my own skills such as technical, communication, intrapersonal, interpersonal and soft skills. This would not have happened without the support of my solid and familial team.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my opinion, even though working in BCA is very challenging since we have to continuously adapt to external changes. This is what makes working at BCA enjoyable and not boring.</span></p>"}}
