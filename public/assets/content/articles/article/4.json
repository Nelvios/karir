The new achievement will supersede the one million sales of the Redmi Note 7 that the Chinese company announced in early February -- within just three weeks after launching the handset in China. While the Redmi Note 7 debuted in China in January, Xiaomi also started the global rollout of the new model by bringing it to India last month. The company also added the Redmi Note 7 Pro to the Redmi Note 7 lineup that is likely to contribute to its overall growth in the coming days.</span></p>", "title": "Redmi Note 7, Redmi Note 7 Pro Will Sell 4 Million Units by March-End, Xiaomi CEO Projects"}}
